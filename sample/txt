My mum (82F) told me (12M) to do the dishes (16) but I (12M) was too busy playing Fortnite (3 kills) so I (12M) grabbed my controller (DualShock 4) and threw it at her (138kph). She fucking died, and I (12M) went to prison (18 years). While in prison I (12M) incited several riots (3) and assumed leadership of a gang responsible for smuggling drugs (cocaine) into the country. I (12M) also ordered the assassination of several celebrities (Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Jeffrey Epstein) and planned a terrorist attack (9/11). Reddit, AITA? Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops. Number one. Steady hand. One day, Kim Jong Un need new heart. I do operation. But mistake! Kim Jong Un die! SSD very mad! I hide fishing boat, come to America. No English, no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car and new woman. Darryl save life. My big secret. I kill Kim Jong Un on purpose. I good surgeon. The best! Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended. I honestly hate British people so much. It pisses me off that we have to share the American language with them. Australians, Canadians, South Africans, Kiwis, and Irish people are all cool and normal people. British people are literally the stupidest people I have ever encountered. Everything about them is idiotic. They think they sound so cool when they use their wobbly dobby slangy wangy but they end up sounding like elementary students from a trailer park. I‚Äôm sick of seeing them and having to deal with them in entertainment and pop culture simply because they share our language. They are all dreadfully ugly and constantly drunk, unbearably boring and complacent, and overall despicable company to be around.If god created the world in six days then the British certainly must have been made during his morning shit on the sabbath.Wrong. Paraclitoris Danksmell Memegay is very dishonest riffing. honest riffs: big chonky eighth notes and quarter notes, big bluesy grooves, big beer for big nuts, v v fast, extreme speed headbangenings aaaaaarrrrrrrrrrhhh dishonest riffs: microtonal intervals, negative harmony, compound rhythms, atonal chords, tempo shifts, complex time signatures, unusual chord progressions, non-western scales, oh my god I read derrida once and now I can't stop gargling dicks, look at me I know like five words of greek, noodly jazzfag wankery, weedly wangly suck my wangy if you disagree you will not understood the kult, do not entryMostrar menos KEQING......
